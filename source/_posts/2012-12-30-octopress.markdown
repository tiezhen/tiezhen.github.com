This blog mainly contains notes of various technics. It has been also
used as a spot for me to share my experiences. 

Originally, this blog was hosted on blogspot. I've decided to migrate the site
to octopress based on Github for the following reasons:

- It's hard to get code syntax highting on blog: There is no native syntax
  highlighting on blgospot. I need to create code snippets and add related js
code in blogspot. Considering the amount of source code in this blog, the
management is a nightmare.
- Blogspot is censored in China: Considering the difficulties of my chinese
  reader, it's better for me to have a full managed blog service, and be able to
switch to other solutions in case my original host is censored.
- Octopress has native Markdown support.

Well, as always, there are still some disadvantags using Octopress

- Most important of all, it's getting impossible to udpate the blog over the
  air. Octopress force me to have a ruby environment in order to update my blog.
Well, in the same time, the nice thing is that I can update my blog at any time
even without internet connection as long as I have my client. :-)

This blog is using a template used on:
